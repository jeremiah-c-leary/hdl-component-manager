Bug Reports
###########

If you run into anything that is not handled correctly, please submit an issue.
When creating the issue, use the **bug** label to highlight it.
Fixing bugs is prioritized over feature enhancements.

Code Base Improvements
######################

HCM started out to solve a problem and improve my Python skills.
The learning part is still on going, and I am sure the code base could be improved.
I run the code through *Codacy* and *Code Climate*, and they are very helpful.
However, I would appreciate any suggestions to improve the code base.

Create an issue and use the **refactor** label for any code which could be improved.

Feature Requests
################

Let me know if there is anything I could add to make HCM easier to use.

If you have an idea for a new feature, create an issue with the **enhancement** label.

Pull Requests
#############

Pull requests are always welcome.
I am trying to follow a Test Driven Development (TDD) process.
If you do add a new feature or fix a bug, I would appreciate a new or updated test to go along with the change.
If not, then I will add a test to cover any updates.

I use *Travis CI* to run all the tests.
*Codacy* and *Code Climate* are my quality control tools.
Code coverage is reported by *Codcov*.

*Travis CI* will run these tools when a pull request is made.
The results will be available on the pull request Github page.

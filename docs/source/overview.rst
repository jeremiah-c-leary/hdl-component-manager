Overview
========

HDL Component Manager (HCM) is a tool to manage IP blocks in an SVN repository.
It simplifies the sharing of hdl components between projects without having to perform merges.

With HCM you can:

#. Add new components
#. Easily switch between versions components
#. Easily publish updates to existing components


Why HCM?
--------

Support for packaging of HDL languages lags software implementations.
Software has many package managers, e.g. PIP, NPM, APT.
HCM is an attempt to provide similar capabilities of those package managers for HDL development.

Goals
-----

* Frictionless sharing of HDL IP components between projects
